**CelebAMask-HQ** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the entertainment industry. 

The dataset consists of 30000 images with 372766 labeled objects belonging to 18 different classes including *skin*, *nose*, *l_lip*, and other: *u_lip*, *hair*, *r_eye*, *l_eye*, *neck*, *l_brow*, *r_brow*, *mouth*, *cloth*, *l_ear*, *r_ear*, *ear_r*, *neck_l*, *eye_g*, and *hat*.

Images in the CelebAMask-HQ dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, every image contains information about visual characteristics of a person.
